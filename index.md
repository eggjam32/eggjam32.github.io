## Professional Self-Assessment
Throughout the Computer Science program at SNHU, completing the coursework and developing my ePortfolio have significantly aided me in preparing me for employment and in developing my professional goals and values. Upon entering the program, my intention was to gain the knowledge and skills to become a software engineer. Now that I am exiting the program, I can confidently say that I feel prepared to do so. Along the way, I have learned so much about computer science, mathematics, algorithms, communication, project management, and much more. The value that encompasses all areas is integrity. Software engineers, or anyone in the technology sector for that matter, have an obligation to put forward their best work without cutting corners. This value has been developed throughout this program and will always be the core of my work ethic. 

In this program, I learned to collaborate in a team environment through the countless discussion boards and through the material from courses such as the CS-250 Software Development Lifecycle course and the CS-255 System Analysis and Design course. Such courses and materials helped me model different members of a team, such as product owner, project manager, and developer to gain a better understanding of collaboration from different perspectives. Along these lines, such classes afforded me the opportunity to practice communicating with stakeholders to determine requirements, check progress, and deliver desired products. Foundational mathematic classes such as MAT-230 Discrete Mathematics and MAT-350 Applied Linear Algebra provided a foundation for understanding how algorithms work. In tandem with programming classes, these classes developed my knowledge of data structures and algorithms, not to mention CS-300 DSA: Analysis and Design, a class in which we thoroughly analyzed and developed different data structures and algorithms. Software engineering and database knowledge were developed in database classes like DAD-220 and CS-465. In these classes we learned database foundations like the SQL language and how to develop full stack applications that communicated data from an external database to a well-designed front end web application. Throughout each of these categories, security remained a foreground concept. Including robust security in all levels of programming became second nature and in classes like CS-405 Secure Coding, we learned why the vulnerabilities of poor security development were so detrimental; from an application standpoint and a life-saving standpoint. Ultimately, all of these skills work together and support me in my career aspirations. 

The artifacts I chose to complete the enhancements in this portfolio demonstrate a wide range of capabilities within the field of computer science. For the first and third enhancements, I combined the work to create one larger enhancement that covers software engineering and design as well as databases. The artifact, from CS-410 Software Reverse Engineering, is an investment banking application in which admin users can log in and view and edit client data. The two artifact enhancements allowed me to demonstrate firsthand my skills in full stack development, meeting software engineering and design requirements, and database requirements. The application represents a clean design in which a user may interact with a user interface that allows for all functionalities. The database securely stores data in a MongoDB database, allowing for secure retrieval of data and transfer between API endpoints. For more information on these, please review the individual enhancements below. For the second enhancement, I chose an artifact from CS-300 DSA: Analysis and Design in which a runtime analysis was performed, and a system created to search and sort through university course data. For my enhancement, I translated from the C++ programming language to Java and changed the underlying data structure recommended from a Binary Search Tree to a Vector structure. This demonstrated an ability to translate between coding languages and correctly analyze different data structures and algorithms to meet the requirements of the project in different ways and to balance tradeoffs in efficiency. For more information on this enhancement, please view the respective section below.

</a>

The artifact I chose for the Software Engineering and Design category is the project for the class CS410 - Software Reverse Engineering. In Project One and Project Two, the requirements were to disassemble a binary file, interpret the assembly, write the corresponding C++ code, determine vulnerabilities, and fix the vulnerabilities that were fixable within the scope of the projects and class. The ultimate goal of these projects was to demonstrate an ability to reverse engineer legacy code for modern systems while addressing security concerns. For this category enhancement, I developed a full-stack application for the SNHU Investments investment banking application. This application, developed using a MEAN architecture, includes an Express page for client interaction, an Angular single-page administrator application, and a MongoDB database. This artifact is developed in tandem with the Databases category. I selected this artifact due to its potential to become a solid full-stack application that would allow me to demonstrate many computer science skills. I improved this artifact greatly by taking the essence of the low-level system in the binary file and creating a high level, multi-layered application to achieve the same goals much better. The app achieves all original requirements while functioning at a much higher level through the use of the Express and Angular site pages. The design document displays my ability to create an executive summary, to define project constraints, and to disassemble a binary file and explain the functionality. The full stack application demonstrates my ability to translate requirements into an application and to develop an application using the MEAN architecture. Ultimately, the artifact displays my ability to create full stack applications that are secure and functional.

Through the design document, I was able to demonstrate an ability to build a collaborative environment that promotes organizational decision-making by creating the document itself. I have also demonstrated, through the code review and design document, my ability to provide solid communications to multiple audiences. The full stack application also demonstrates my abilities to use different tools and techniques to achieve the creation of an investment banking application. This application also tackles security at all points in the application to ensure that data is secure and that users are correctly authenticated and authorized. I plan on meeting other outcomes in other enhancements and elaborating on these as I make tweaks to the artifact.

As I created this artifact enhancement, I learned quite a few things. I learned mainly that skills from the past may not directly translate. Some of the full stack tools I had used in the past were not working the same as when I had learned them. I had to learn how to employ creative solutions and do research on how to fix issues in an application. That also reflects challenges I faced in learning as I went. I had to learn new ways to achieve goals which is ultimately a necessary skill in computer science.

</a>

The artifact I selected for this enhancement is the CS300 DSA: Analysis and Design final project. In this project, the goal was to take information from a data file, perform a runtime analysis on three data structures, determine the most appropriate data structure to meet searching and sorting project requirements, and then develop the code using this data structure. For this project, I used a binary search tree algorithm in the C++ coding language to achieve this task. For the sake of this enhancement, I am assuming that the fictional university, ABCU University, wants the program to be translated into the Java programming language and for the searching and sorting algorithm used to be the fastest algorithm during runtime. Based on a runtime analysis, this is a vector-based searching and sorting algorithm. Therefore, to enhance this artifact, I created a Java-based vector-based searching and sorting algorithm to sort course data for the fictional university. I chose this artifact as it enables me to demonstrate many skills regarding data structures and algorithms as well as other computer science skills like translating between coding languages and runtime analysis.

![Enhancement 2 - BST](/Screenshots/Enhancement2_2.png)

In the images above, I completed a runtime analysis of a vector-based searching and sorting algorithm and of a binary search tree-based algorithm, respectively. Through these analyses, I was able to determine that for small data sets, a vector-based algorithm would allow me to efficiently achieve the requirements of the project without compromising efficiency. With large datasets however, I determined that it would be much more efficient to use a binary search tree, but this was not necessary given the project requirements and scale.

This artifact afforded me the opportunity to learn how to translate data structures and algorithms between coding languages. The class I had taken was primarily in C++, so I learned how to create various algorithms using C++ data structures. Taking the time to translate to the equivalent Java data structures enhanced my knowledge of systems as a whole and gave me an opportunity to demonstrate a knowledge of computer science theory, not just a per-language memorization of certain algorithms. I faced the challenge of trying to find the course data dataset in my past files. Luckily, I was able to find this text file online. I did not face many challenges when developing the system as I knew what had to be done and executed this without errors presenting themselves.

The artifact I chose to meet the Databases category enhancement is the CS410 Software Reverse Engineering final project. In Project One and Project Two, the requirements were to disassemble a binary file, interpret the assembly, write the corresponding C++ code, determine vulnerabilities, and fix the vulnerabilities that were fixable within the scope of the projects and class. The goal of these projects was to demonstrate an ability to reverse engineer legacy code for modern systems while addressing security concerns. For this category enhancement, I developed a full-stack application with an external database for the SNHU Investments investment banking application. This application, developed using a MEAN architecture, includes an Express page for client interaction, an Angular single-page administrator application, and a MongoDB database. I selected this project to develop in tandem with the first category enhancement of software engineering and design. These go well together in a full-stack application and allowed me to demonstrate a wide range of skills and meet the category enhancements for both projects. In the original files, all client data in the system was hardcoded into the C++ application. All user credentials, like usernames and passwords, were hardcoded into the program as well. This created a severe security vulnerability in which hackers who gained access to the files could have quickly and easily identified user data and credentials allowing them to log in and steal data. Hardcoded credentials are a terrible security practice so my main goal with the database enhancement was to secure this data in the application using a database and other security practices like authentication, authorization, and encryption. I implemented these changes through the MongoDB database, encryption practices such as hashing, authorization measures like JWT tokens, and authentication measures through separately stored credentials. To prevent users from accessing admin privileges, each user is given a role and is directed upon logging in to the side of the application they are meant to interact with. Admin privileges include accessing and editing all user information. Client privileges are limited to viewing just their data.

# MongoDB Compass View 2
![Enhancement 3_2 MongoDB Clients Collection](/Screenshots/Enhancement3_2.png)

In the collections above, you can see that the users collection has one more document than the clients collection. This is due to the project structure in which admin are separated from clients and routed through the login process to their respective admin site. In future iterations of this application, utilizing a specific admin collection and developing the structure of the database further would be beneficial as it would make the system more robust.

When developing the application, I ran into a few problems. I initially had to figure out how to differentiate in the database between clients and admin. To do this, I created a super-class of users called User in which a role was created to help the system identify if the user is a client or an admin. The implementation of this was rather smooth and I did not have much trouble with the models for clients and admin versus general users. My big issue had to do with routing the data from the database through the correct API endpoints. The issue was that data was being requested from the database and being returned as JSON, which was fine for the express site. However, for the admin site, none of the data would display correctly. Initially, it would just show raw JSON, which made it easy to find the problem, but I had to learn how to convert this data into objects for each client. Once I implemented objects, the data still would not display. It took me a long time to discover that my routing was incomplete. I had never introduced a specific routing file in the API side of the application to handle sending the data correctly to the admin SPA. Once this was added, the data displayed and all of the cascading problems went away, and the application worked as intended. Through this process, I learned a lot about routing data through API endpoints while balancing JWT tokens as well as how to convert JSON to objects. This also helped me learn how to work through frustration for a long time. I spent many hours looking at the issue without being able to identify it and I became frustrated. I learned to just take some breaks, step away, and come back with fresh eyes to analyze a problem. In the end, I improved the project, got it to work as intended, and achieved the enhancement goal I had expected.

## Course Outcomes
### Outcome 1: Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science
I employed strategies for building collaborative environments that enabled diverse audiences to support organizational decision making through all projects. Specifically, I created a detailed code review, developed thorough software design documentation, included comments directly within my code, and maintained journals of my progress for each enhancement. These strategies provided transparency and clarity, allowing team members with varying technical experience to understand every aspect of a given project. This approach facilitated collaboration and informed decision-making in a professional context, including setting project requirements, prioritizing updates, and coordinating enhancements. By structuring my work to be accessible and well-documented, I ensured that organizational decisions could be made efficiently and with input from diverse perspectives.

### Outcome 2: Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts
I designed, developed, and delivered professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications through multiple aspects of my projects. The primary examples include code reviews and software design documents, which were carefully structured to explain technical processes and decisions clearly. These communications were technically accurate, coherent, and adapted to both technical and non-technical audiences. Visual aids, such as diagrams and flowcharts in my design documentation, allowed readers to quickly grasp complex structures, while written and oral explanations provided depth and context. By ensuring that every form of communication was tailored to its intended audience, I was able to effectively convey project requirements, progress, and outcomes in a professional manner.

### Outcome 3: Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices
I designed and evaluated computing solutions in the data structures and algorithms enhancement by applying algorithmic principles and computer science practices to solve real-world problems. I conducted runtime analyses of multiple data structures, carefully comparing their performance characteristics, and selecting the most appropriate structures to meet project requirements. I also translated solutions between programming languages to satisfy project constraints, demonstrating flexibility and technical skill. Using these approaches, I efficiently implemented searching and sorting algorithms for university course data while balancing trade-offs such as runtime efficiency, memory usage, and code maintainability. This process ensured that my solutions adhered to professional standards and were both practical and optimized for the problem at hand.

### Outcome 4: Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals
I demonstrated an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices across all projects. For example, I developed a full-stack application using the MEAN architecture with a MongoDB database, applied data structure analysis to optimize performance, and translated between programming languages to meet specific requirements. I also implemented security best practices and integrated industry-standard workflows to ensure that the solutions I developed were robust, maintainable, and aligned with professional expectations. These techniques allowed me to deliver solutions that not only met the technical requirements of each project but also added value. Ultimately, I demonstrated a practical application of industry-specific skills in software engineering, full-stack development, and secure computing practices.

### Outcome 5: Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources
I developed a security mindset in the first and third enhancements by proactively considering potential threats and implementing measures to mitigate vulnerabilities. User data was securely stored in a database rather than hardcoded, passwords were hashed, and authentication and authorization were enforced through secure login practices and JWT. I also implemented comprehensive error handling across all projects to prevent undefined behavior and reduce the risk of security breaches. Security considerations were integrated from the beginning of the project, demonstrating my ability to anticipate adversarial exploits and protect sensitive data. By prioritizing security throughout the development process, I ensured that the applications maintained privacy, reliability, and resilience against potential attacks.
