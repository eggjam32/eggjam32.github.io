# Enhancement One - Software Design and Engineering

The artifact I chose for the Software Engineering and Design category is the project for the class CS410 - Software Reverse Engineering. In Project One and Project Two, the requirements were to disassemble a binary file, interpret the assembly, write the corresponding C++ code, determine vulnerabilities, and fix the vulnerabilities that were fixable within the scope of the projects and class. The ultimate goal of these projects was to demonstrate an ability to reverse engineer legacy code for modern systems while addressing security concerns. For this category enhancement, I developed a full-stack application for the SNHU Investments investment banking application. This application, developed using a MEAN architecture, includes an Express page for client interaction, an Angular single-page administrator application, and a MongoDB database. This artifact is developed in tandem with the Databases category. I selected this artifact due to its potential to become a solid full-stack application that would allow me to demonstrate many computer science skills. I improved this artifact greatly by taking the essence of the low-level system in the binary file and creating a high level, multi-layered application to achieve the same goals much better. The app achieves all original requirements while functioning at a much higher level through the use of the Express and Angular site pages. The design document displays my ability to create an executive summary, to define project constraints, and to disassemble a binary file and explain the functionality. The full stack application demonstrates my ability to translate requirements into an application and to develop an application using the MEAN architecture. Ultimately, the artifact displays my ability to create full stack applications that are secure and functional.

Through the design document, I was able to demonstrate an ability to build a collaborative environment that promotes organizational decision-making by creating the document itself. I have also demonstrated, through the code review and design document, my ability to provide solid communications to multiple audiences. The full stack application also demonstrates my abilities to use different tools and techniques to achieve the creation of an investment banking application. This application also tackles security at all points in the application to ensure that data is secure and that users are correctly authenticated and authorized. I plan on meeting other outcomes in other enhancements and elaborating on these as I make tweaks to the artifact.

As I created this artifact enhancement, I learned quite a few things. I learned mainly that skills from the past may not directly translate. Some of the full stack tools I had used in the past were not working the same as when I had learned them. I had to learn how to employ creative solutions and do research on how to fix issues in an application. That also reflects challenges I faced in learning as I went. I had to learn new ways to achieve goals which is ultimately a necessary skill in computer science.

# Enhancement Two - Data Structures and Algorithms

The artifact I selected for this enhancement is the CS300 DSA: Analysis and Design final project. In this project, the goal was to take information from a data file, perform a runtime analysis on three data structures, determine the most appropriate data structure to meet searching and sorting project requirements, and then develop the code using this data structure. For this project, I used a binary search tree algorithm in the C++ coding language to achieve this task. For the sake of this enhancement, I am assuming that the fictional university, ABCU University, wants the program to be translated into the Java programming language and for the searching and sorting algorithm used to be the fastest algorithm during runtime. Based on a runtime analysis, this is a vector-based searching and sorting algorithm. Therefore, to enhance this artifact, I created a Java-based vector-based searching and sorting algorithm to sort course data for the fictional university. I chose this artifact as it enables me to demonstrate many skills regarding data structures and algorithms as well as other computer science skills like translating between coding languages and runtime analysis.

I had originally intended to meet course outcomes 2, 3, 4, and 5. Through the code review process and the runtime analysis, I have contributed to meeting course outcome 2 as each is an effective form of communication regarding details of the project to nontechnical and technical audiences. The main course outcome that I intended on achieving in Module One is course outcome 3. This artifact meets this outcome as it solves the problem of searching and sorting course information while balancing the tradeoffs between different algorithms, namely BSTs and vectors, ultimately demonstrating a solid understanding and application of data structures and algorithms. Outcome 4 is met by this artifact as it is a clear demonstration of the utilization of different computer science tools, techniques, and skills to deliver the industry-specific goal of developing a system that achieves the searching and sorting desired by ABCU University. Lastly, outcome 5 is met by the inclusion of basic error handling. While this is not a big application, inputs are checked and handled correctly in case of improper input types or failed file reading. This prevents undefined behavior from compromising the system. 

This artifact afforded me the opportunity to learn how to translate data structures and algorithms between coding languages. The class I had taken was primarily in C++, so I learned how to create various algorithms using C++ data structures. Taking the time to translate to the equivalent Java data structures enhanced my knowledge of systems as a whole and gave me an opportunity to demonstrate a knowledge of computer science theory, not just a per-language memorization of certain algorithms. I faced the challenge of trying to find the course data dataset in my past files. Luckily, I was able to find this text file online. I did not face many challenges when developing the system as I knew what had to be done and executed this without errors presenting themselves.
