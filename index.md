# Enhancement One - Software Design and Engineering

The artifact I chose for the Software Engineering and Design category is the project for the class CS410 - Software Reverse Engineering. In Project One and Project Two, the requirements were to disassemble a binary file, interpret the assembly, write the corresponding C++ code, determine vulnerabilities, and fix the vulnerabilities that were fixable within the scope of the projects and class. The ultimate goal of these projects was to demonstrate an ability to reverse engineer legacy code for modern systems while addressing security concerns. For this category enhancement, I developed a full-stack application for the SNHU Investments investment banking application. This application, developed using a MEAN architecture, includes an Express page for client interaction, an Angular single-page administrator application, and a MongoDB database. This artifact is developed in tandem with the Databases category. I selected this artifact due to its potential to become a solid full-stack application that would allow me to demonstrate many computer science skills. I improved this artifact greatly by taking the essence of the low-level system in the binary file and creating a high level, multi-layered application to achieve the same goals much better. The app achieves all original requirements while functioning at a much higher level through the use of the Express and Angular site pages. The design document displays my ability to create an executive summary, to define project constraints, and to disassemble a binary file and explain the functionality. The full stack application demonstrates my ability to translate requirements into an application and to develop an application using the MEAN architecture. Ultimately, the artifact displays my ability to create full stack applications that are secure and functional.

Through the design document, I was able to demonstrate an ability to build a collaborative environment that promotes organizational decision-making by creating the document itself. I have also demonstrated, through the code review and design document, my ability to provide solid communications to multiple audiences. The full stack application also demonstrates my abilities to use different tools and techniques to achieve the creation of an investment banking application. This application also tackles security at all points in the application to ensure that data is secure and that users are correctly authenticated and authorized. I plan on meeting other outcomes in other enhancements and elaborating on these as I make tweaks to the artifact.

As I created this artifact enhancement, I learned quite a few things. I learned mainly that skills from the past may not directly translate. Some of the full stack tools I had used in the past were not working the same as when I had learned them. I had to learn how to employ creative solutions and do research on how to fix issues in an application. That also reflects challenges I faced in learning as I went. I had to learn new ways to achieve goals which is ultimately a necessary skill in computer science.
